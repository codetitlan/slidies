Slide Deck Outline: “AI, Codetitlan, and Our Future”

⸻

Slide 1: Introduction – AI: Revolution or Evolution?
• Suggested Content:
• Quote or provocative statement: “AI is not a single technology; it’s a constellation of efforts aimed at emulating what we thought made us uniquely human.”
• Key terms: Reasoning, Classification, Emulation, Human-level intelligence.
• Monologue starter:
“When we speak about AI, we’re talking about a massive technological push to replicate aspects of human cognition and decision-making, previously thought impossible for machines. It’s both an evolution of tools and a revolutionary shift in how we define human work.”

⸻

Slide 2: AI and the Redefinition of Value
• Suggested Content:
• Highlight: Traditional human skills replicated by AI – classification, prediction, analysis.
• Bullet point: “AI challenges the traditional paradigm of value generation.”
• Question for reflection: “If AI takes over routine cognitive tasks, where does that leave us?”
• Monologue starter:
“The true revolution is in how AI is reshaping the concept of ‘value’ itself. Jobs once secure because they required intelligence alone are now open to automation, forcing us to rethink our roles in society.”

⸻

Slide 3: Beyond Intelligence – The Human Advantage
• Suggested Content:
• List uniquely human aspects AI struggles to replicate effectively:
• Deep empathy
• Cultural alignment
• Historical consciousness
• Ethical judgment
• Creative and emotional intelligence
• Monologue starter:
“Humans remain indispensable not because AI can’t think, but because true understanding involves more than just data processing—it involves empathy, ethics, and cultural depth.”

Slide 4: AI in My Region – Querétaro & Bajío Realities
• Suggested Content:
• Practical local examples:
• Air pollution predictive models
• Smart agriculture applications
• Health and education case studies
• Visual: Quick infographic or symbolic imagery of Querétaro’s AI applications.
• Monologue starter:
“AI is not just theoretical. In Querétaro, it’s already predicting air quality, helping farmers optimize crops, and potentially improving health services. But this is just the beginning.”

⸻

Slide 5: The Dark Side of AI Infrastructure – Data Centers and Water Scarcity
• Suggested Content:
• Fact highlight: Querétaro’s water deficit due to data centers (56.8 billion liters)
• Image suggestion: Visual contrast (data center vs dry landscape)
• Bullet point: “Local communities actively resisting due to environmental impact”
• Monologue starter:
“With every AI advancement comes infrastructure that demands enormous resources. Querétaro is at a crossroads—balancing technology-driven growth with essential human needs like water.”

⸻

Slide 6: Navigating Labor Market Disruption
• Suggested Content:
• Highlight: “65% of jobs at potential risk of automation in Mexico”
• Strategic response: Need for new skills training, digital literacy, and job transitions
• Visual suggestion: Pie chart or graph showing risk areas
• Monologue starter:
“Automation will reshape the Bajío labor market significantly. But rather than a doomsday scenario, this is an invitation to prepare, adapt, and evolve.”
